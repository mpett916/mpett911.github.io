        <h1>MORGAN PETTINGILL</h1>
        <h2>Freshman from Davison, Michigan</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying creative writing with a minor in business. 
             I am a member of the makeup crew for BJU productions. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach efforts with my society and 
            my church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church. I help to hold services and visit with 
            residents in nursing homes, and I actively volunteer my 
            time at my church by singing in the choir and assisting in youth ministry programs.
         </p> 
         <p>
             I enjoy writing, reading, and last but not least, napping.
         </p>
